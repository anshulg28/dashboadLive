Don’t miss the prizes at the end.</p><p><strong>What are the Doolally Beer Olympics?</strong><br />We believe that beer drinking is a legitimate athletic pursuit and champions of this sport should be celebrated as heroes! The problem is that feats of \'real life\' athleticism - Someone downing a pint of beer in 5 seconds or the brave soul who boards the Virar fast and aspires to get off at Andheri - are not even recorded, let alone being celebrated. It\'s time to end this inequity.</p><p>So, if you can play Jenga with your left arm while chugging with your right AND push your beer belly to the very limit, then the Doolally Beer Olympics 2017 is for you. The celebration consists of multiple beer related events in which teams compete to win the greatest reward a beer athlete can aspire for - The Golden Mug!</p><p>So if you profess an undying love for beer, then it time to come out and stake a claim to be recognized as a bonafide beer athlete! On your mark, get set, CHUGGGGGG!</p><p><strong>Games</strong><br />This year, we have created games that will test your mental, physical and verbal skills - under the influence, of course. We have Beer Jenga, Fletter, Darts, Pong and all time favourite, Chug Relay.</p><p><strong>Fee & Prizes</strong><br />You will need a team of four, a belly made of steel, Rs 8000 bucks (Rs 2000 per head) and drunken determination. For the fee, each athlete will get a Beer Olympic Kit, five games (all four of you will play all five games), a snack box and two liters of beer. Plus, you have a shot at winning Doolally beer in each of the five games + an awesome grand prize (+more beer)!</p><p><strong>Doolally Wagon</strong><br />For teams from Mumbai, we\'re running The Doolally Wagon (AC Bus) from Doolally Bandra to Corinthians, Pune & back for Rs 800 per head.
